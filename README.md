_Note: On Mac, you may be prompted saying the program is not verified or signed, that is because I am not paying for the Apple Developer License. To get around it, close the prompt, go to Settings -> Privacy & Security then all the way at the bottom there will be a new item saying something along the lines of "Allow Lazymux", click that, run the program again, and then continue through the prompts it gives. It will only prompt you once about this._
